WordPress B. Organiser
======================

WordPress B. Organiser is a TF2 match organiser designed for the tf2au reddit.


Using
-----

Simply install and activate this theme, and boom, the system.

I'd prefer if you forked the project and changed the style to suit your site,
but it's open source, so I don't care. :)


About
-----

WPBO was created in order to help organise pick-up games for redditors. I've
made it open in the hopes that others can use it for inspiration and
organisation.

WPBO was made by Ryan McCue, who can be found at http://ryanmccue.info/


What's with the name?
---------------------

"WordPress B. Organiser" (WPBO) was originally "WordPress-Based PUG Organiser"
(WBPO), but I could never get the letter order right. It was easier just to
make a (crappy) backronym.
